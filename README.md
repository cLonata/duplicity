## V4

**V4** marks a complete overhaul of the project’s architecture.

The previous version relied heavily on a complex web of legacy tools. This made long-term maintenance difficult, slowed development, and limited compatibility.

To address these issues, **V4 is a full rewrite** from the ground up using modern web technologies:

- ✅ **Next.js** — Simplified routing and easy static site generation for GitHub Pages support.
- ✅ **React** — Component-driven UI, no Redux or global state complexity.
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** — Fast and responsive styling with utility classes.
- ✅ **No TypeScript** — Now using plain JavaScript to lower the barrier for contribution.
- ✅ **Client-side only** — All functionality runs in the browser. No backend, no data upload, no privacy concerns.

This approach improves maintainability, performance, and makes it easier to add features going forward.

> 🔧 **Note**: This project is a modern fork of the original and popular [`oni-duplicity`](https://github.com/RoboPhred/oni-duplicity) by **RoboPhred**.  
> The new version is rewritten and maintained by **[cLonata](https://github.com/cLonata)**.
